HOUSEKEEPING
- mobile navbar row colgitouring on select/focus
- spacing between cats and sorts on products.html
- error pages - picture not working?
- index tiles - content on all, Stripe one seems mis-aligned?
- change index to series of rows
- datepicker for add event form
- responsiveness testing
- can DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL be changed to orders@bellaciao.ie?
- Test CRUD functionality for events and products on Heroku, change URL on product to optional?
- do all restricted links (requiring either authentication or superuser status) have @login_required and redirect to home or 404?
- as above, does 404 need a view and url when someone has to be redirected there
- debug false

STUDENT CARE:
- DONE ONCE - Ensure that users not logged in are redirected to the login page. 
- DONE ONCE - Check that authentication cannot be bypassed by typing the URL into the browser bar - create custom 403/404 pages 
to deal with this. 
- Make sure you have checked that no links result in an internal server error. 
- If you have included a user type with higher access privileges, then you can include example login credentials at submission. 
- Do not display links the user does not have the privileges to access.
