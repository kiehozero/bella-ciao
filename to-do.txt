HOUSEKEEPING
- add aria tags for all icons
- make eircode mandatory in checkout form
- all alt tags for all imgs
- move form CSS for checkout (and any other app that has forms.py) into forms.py using the field.widget.attrs['class'] methods
- go through CSS files and see where padding and margin settings can be replaced by Bootstrap tags (line 29 base.css)
- profile models and forms show good examples of how to customise, use of widgets at __str__
- once code is completed, open all sheets and clean up any items that show up in the problems tab
- upload final db-schema.png in planning folder
- scroll bar in cart table on smaller desktop screens?
- cart update and remove hover buttons

NEED TO HAVE:
- change delivery to a flat fee below threshold to remove ambiguity against rounding, write up full bugfix
- USER STORY: loyalty
- rounding issue still showing up on orders containing items that don't end in a zero
- set up Heroku webhook on deployment
- contact form (use pintbaby)
- finalise landing header, move to includes if it stays being used on multiple pages (index, all products)
- sort out exact routing of add/delete event views, some load back to event page, some back to list of events. Delete from
within profile and join from within event working fine, need to check admin removing from event, user joining from event list

NICE TO HAVE:
- event attendance calculation
- edit product or event from admin panel (dropdown to select product on form, see product form category choice)
