HOUSEKEEPING
- mobile navbar row colouring on select/focus
- spacing between cats and sorts on products.html
- error pages - picture not working?
- index tiles - content on all, Stripe one seems mis-aligned?
- change index to series of rows
- datepicker for add event form
- responsiveness testing
- take small text off of order history on larger devices
- can DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL by changed to orders@bellaciao.ie?
- Test CRUD functionality for events and products on Heroku, change URL on product to optional?
- Take order number out of header text, it's too large on the order summary

NICE TO HAVE:
- contact form (use pintbaby)
