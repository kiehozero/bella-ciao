HOUSEKEEPING
- add aria tags for all icons
- make eircode mandatory in checkout form
- all alt tags for all imgs
- move form CSS for checkout (and any other app that has forms.py) into forms.py using the field.widget.attrs['class'] methods
- go through CSS files and see where padding and margin settings can be replaced by Bootstrap tags (line 29 base.css)
- profile models and forms show good examples of how to customise, use of widgets at __str__
- once code is completed, open all sheets and clean up any items that show up in the problems tab
- upload final db-schema.png in planning folder

NEED TO HAVE:
- USER STORY: loyalty
- contact form (use pintbaby)
- finalise landing header, move to includes if it stays being used on multiple pages (index, all products)
- sort out exact routing of add/delete event views, some load back to event page, some back to list of events

NICE TO HAVE:
- event attendance calculation
- Add VAT category to each item, populate and then use to calculate total tax in card-total elements?
- edit product or event from admin panel (dropdown to select product on form, see product form category choice)
