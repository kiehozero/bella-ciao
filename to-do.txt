HOUSEKEEPING

- delete account view? no cascading to orders
- spreadsheet of image credits list (column A, product/event, column B website, column C link)
- duplicate events (and users?) into Heroku, loaddata command?
- more products and events (28 products (10 coffee, 5 specials, 3 tea, 2 desserts, 2 snacks, 4 merch), 10 events)
- check all sized products again for drop-downs
- why is the quantity select on view_product working but not in cart?
