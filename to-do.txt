STUDENT CARE:
- DONE ONCE - Ensure that users not logged in are redirected to the login page. 
- DONE ONCE - Check that authentication cannot be bypassed by typing the URL into the browser bar - create custom 403/404 pages 
to deal with this. 
- Make sure you have checked that no links result in an internal server error. 
- If you have included a user type with higher access privileges, then you can include example login credentials at submission. 
- Do not display links the user does not have the privileges to access.
