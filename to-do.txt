HOUSEKEEPING
- make eircode mandatory in checkout form
- move form CSS for checkout (and any other app that has forms.py) into forms.py using the field.widget.attrs['class'] methods
- go through CSS files and see where padding and margin settings can be replaced by Bootstrap tags (line 29 base.css)
- profile models and forms show good examples of how to customise, use of widgets at __str__
- once code is completed, open all sheets and clean up any items that show up in the problems tab
- upload final db-schema.png in planning folder
- scroll bar in cart table on smaller desktop screens?

NEED TO HAVE:
- if a user is already attending an event, prevent them from doing so again (search EventAttendees for user, then search for 
event), add this to join view as an if loop
- USER STORY: loyalty
- rounding issue still showing up on orders containing items that don't end in a zero, write up full bugfix
- set up Heroku webhook on deployment
- contact form (use pintbaby)
- event model needs an image url field?
