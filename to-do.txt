Housekeeping

- add aria tags for all icons
- make eircode mandatory in checkout form
- all alt tags for all imgs
- uniform whitespace header for all pages after index
- move form CSS for checkout (and any other app that has forms.py) into forms.py using the field.widget.attrs['class'] methods
- want to send collection customers a QR code they can scan on arrival
- want to be able to give customers a reward at a certain number of loyalty points, what to do if transaction value is zero?
Display idea is that once the user hits a threshold, their option to redeem is displayed in the cart and subtracts the price
of a selected item to zero
- want to add more than just size as a custom option, is there a way of adding multiple items to items_by_size without a ton
of nested ifs? Obvious solution seems to be to add each size as a different product but I want to push the logic a bit rather
than following the tutorial like most people

Pages:

- add Event
- join event view
- delivery/collection
- loyalty

Nice to have:
- Add VAT category to each item, populate and then use to calculate total tax in card-total elements?
- edit product or event from admin panel (dropdown to select product on form, see product form category choice)
