HOUSEKEEPING
- mobile navbar row colgitouring on select/focus
- spacing between cats and sorts on products.html
- error pages - picture not working?
- index tiles - content on all, Stripe one seems mis-aligned?
- change index to series of rows
- datepicker for add event form
- responsiveness testing
- can DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL be changed to orders@bellaciao.ie?
- Test CRUD functionality for events and products on Heroku, change URL on product to optional?
- do all restricted links (requiring either authentication or superuser status) have @login_required and redirect to home or 404?
- as above, does 404 need a view and url when someone has to be redirected there

NICE TO HAVE:
- contact form (use pintbaby)
