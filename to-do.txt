Meeting

- plan is to open store with a modal of three options, DELIVERY, COLLECTION, SUBSCRIPTION. Subscription is unlimited drinks
at a monthly price (Pret model). Collection is from a selection of stores, delivery is the same as BA tutorial
- want to send collection customers a QR code they can scan on arrival
- want to be able to give customers a reward at a certain number of loyalty points, what to do if transaction value is zero?
Display idea is that once the user hits a threshold, their option to redeem is displayed in the cart and subtracts the price
of a selected item to zero
- want to add more than just size as a custom option, is there a way of adding multiple items to items_by_size without a ton
of nested ifs? Obvious solution seems to be to add each size as a different product but I want to push the logic a bit rather
than following the tutorial like most people
